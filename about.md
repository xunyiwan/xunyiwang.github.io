I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Management Science and Systems(MS&S) at School of Mangement, University at
Buffalo, Sate University New York. My research interests are in the areas of online community, social media, social network
analysis and user generated contents. My research aims at deriving insights to facilitate interactions and transactions among
various actors in IT-enabled platforms. In particular, I combine econometric analyses, survey methods, and machine learning to
study the relationships between digital content and engagement behaviors in business pages on social media.
